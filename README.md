# Drvar
Drvar app is my first ever Android app. Manages "drve" orders. It was ment for sync between father's and mine Android phone, but the old guy never wanted a touch screen. So this project is on hold. It needs a rewrite. Trying to implement my own JSON-like protocol was clearly a mistake. Database is empty and "backend" doesn't work anymore :(

Made in late 2013. with Eclipse. Dear god.
